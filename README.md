# 🏏 Real-Time Cricket Match Outcome Prediction Using Ball-by-Ball Analytics and Monte Carlo Simulation

This project predicts the outcome of a live Test match innings using ball-by-ball data and advanced machine learning models. It uses real data from Cricsheet (YAML format), and models the win probability using XGBoost, Neural Networks, and Monte Carlo simulations.

## 📂 Project Structure


---

## 🚀 Features

- Parses real match data from Cricsheet (YAML)
- Builds a ball-by-ball simulation of Test innings
- Extracts meaningful features: run rate, required RR, form, pressure
- Trains:
  - XGBoost Model (classification)
  - Neural Network (Keras)
- Runs Monte Carlo simulations to predict win probability
- Visualizes match progression and win probability over time

---

## 🔍 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- PyYAML

---

## 🧠 Feature Engineering

The following features are computed per ball:
- `cumulative_runs`
- `cumulative_wickets`
- `balls_faced`
- `run_rate`
- `required_runs` / `required_rr`
- `batsman_form` (simulated)
- `pitch_flatness` (simulated)
- `crowd_pressure` (simulated)

## 📈 Model Accuracy

| Model           | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------|
| XGBoost         | ~88%     |
| Neural Network  | ~89%     |

Monte Carlo simulation yields win probabilities with high confidence under realistic match constraints.
